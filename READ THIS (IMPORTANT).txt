Hello.

You will need to install the flutter SDK in order to run this project

https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows

Please follow the instructions up to <Android setup>

Take note that the project folder <SoCyc> has an internal folder of <so_cyc>
- The root project folder <SoCyc> represents the flutter project
	- Dart code stored in SoCyc\so_cyc\lib
- Internal folder <so_cyc> is the android java project
	- Java code stored in SoCyc\so_cyc\android\app\src\main\java\com\DubaiLizards\so_cyc

When you want to open the project, select the <SoCyc> folder, not the nested one

Running on AVD (Emulator) is the same as per java project

Please refer to # ui-resources in discord to find out how to link your java functions to a channel 
Or, refer to MainActivity.java to see how to link your functions, thanks.

As of now ONLY MainActivity.java can be used to set up linked functions, 
still looking into how to allow other classes to link to a MethodChannel
